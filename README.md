# Student-Record-Management-System
Shell Project for my Linux Lab course, the project is a student record management system
The code (script.sh) reads the input file name from the user and reads the data while handling repeated courses, if found, and the existence of more 
than 3 semesters in one academic year, if found. Then the menu is displayed and the user can do many different operations on the dataset given, such
as calculating total average, average per semester, total hours passed/failed, and allows for changing the grade of a course through the script, in
addition to adding a new semester record.
